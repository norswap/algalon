# Patch System

I haven't implemented the patch system, because it doesn't seem like the most important thing
right now. Also, it seems much easier to put together a custom launcher that handles this part
rather than reverse-engineer the WoW system, which is necessarily going to be more limited.

Nevertheless, if one wishes to understand this system, he should look at the Mangos auth server:

In particular:
https://github.com/mangos/realmd/blob/Rel21/Auth/AuthSocket.cpp
(look at HandleLogonProof and the various HandleXfer functions)
https://github.com/mangos/realmd/tree/Rel21/Patch

From preliminary observations, it seems that the patch system is able to send a file (a mpq) to the
client, given its current version. To generate the kind of files needed, this project can help:
